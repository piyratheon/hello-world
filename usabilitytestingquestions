And here are the questions I prepared for the usability tests:
Interview questions (after they played the game)

What do you think/overall/in general? 
General impressions / thoughts?
Tell me about the game, what is it about?
What are the goals, describe them?
Did you understand them?
Did you see any specials? 
Didi you had any issues?
How do you win? What happens when you win?
How do you lose?
In general, what do you think about the game? 
Did you notice / get tutorials?  Any thoughts? 
Do you miss something in the game? 
Any thoughts on the game? 
How about in comparison to similar games? 
What is the best thing about the game? 
What can be improved / worse thing?
What was frustrating? 
What do you think about the difficulty?
What happens when you lose and what when you win? 
Would you play it? Is this a game for you?

Add note: 
if they saw something interesting / unusual player did, they asked questions about it (one player went into settings, they asked why)
